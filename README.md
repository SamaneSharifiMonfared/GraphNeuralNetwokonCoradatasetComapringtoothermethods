This is the code for implementing and testing GNN on Cora dataset and comapring other methods and testing the messaging between nodes with this method.

This code is implemented in Google colab and Kaggle notebook.

Please download the zip file and open it in one of above options.

My recomendation is Kaggle note book as you can add Cora easily and see the result.
